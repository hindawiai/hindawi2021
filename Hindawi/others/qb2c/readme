 Thank you for obtaining this version of QB2C. You can find the latest
 FREE/EVALUATION version of QB2C on this place:
 http://random.com.hr/products/qb2c.html

 See the file ANNOUNCEMENT for information on the commercial version
 of this package.

 QB2C translates BASIC programs into ANSI-C programs. Includes X11-based
 graphics. It has been tested under Linux, OSF1 (DEC), Sun-OS (Solaris),
 Aix (IBM), SGI (Silicon Graphics) and HP-UX (hp).
 Under HP-UX screen dependent things like 'INKEY$' would not work (termios.h),
 for other the full functionality is obtained.
 
 The whole package is in the file qb2c.tgz. To install it, place
 the file in an empty directory and type: tar zxvf qb2c.tgz
 (if this doesn't work try in two steps: gunzip qb2c.tgz; tar xvf qb2c.tar).
 To build executables "qb2c", "bcpp", "calib", "bhelp" and scripts "bcc", 
 "brun" and "run" under given OS just type the name of the corresponding 
 script:

   Operating System |  script to build executables
   -----------------+-----------------------------
   Linux            |  doall
   Linux with no X11|  doall_linux_noX
   DEC-OSF          |  doall_osf
   Sun-OS           |  doall_sun
   IBM-Aix          |  doall_aix
   Silicon Graphics |  doall_sgi
   HP-UX            |  doall_hp

 Executables and scripts should be put somewhere where you
 keep your executables, for instance in ~/bin or /usr/local/bin, or
 the directory where you compiled the QB2C should be put in the search path.

 Details of operation of the package can be found in the document manual.txt,
 which can be wieved typing the command "bhelp".
 A keyword can be specified as a parameter to this command in order to
 get specific help: "bhelp keyword".
